# To Do

#### Urgent

- [X] add emit events for joining board
- [X] check join() is not being called extraneously (and propogated)



#### Nice

- [ ] add mask layer
- [ ] remove image file when not used (avatar change, token change, map delete)
- [ ] only have updates for owner panel in owner board page
- [ ] "unique" option for tokens to behave like avatars when placed
- [ ] context menu for editing icons on board
- [ ] more than one thing in a spot
- [ ] page resize should keep board size ratio constant, not location of top left
- [ ] multiple selected squares
- [ ] add token to board and only have board-level keybindings override user keybindings
- [ ] shift+num to change size of token on board
- [X] save top-left and zoom data in local storage for nice refresh
- [ ] leave board


#### Long Term
- [ ] should Map be its own object?
- [ ] draw masking
- [ ] hex grid
